# knitting_gauge_magic
Calculate needle size based on personal knitting gauge.

Input your knitting gauge and the required yarn and gauge called for in pattern to calculate appropriate needle size based on your personal knitting gauge. 

For example, pattern calls for aran yarn, size 8 (US) needles and the 4" swatch should be 24 stitches by 11 rows.  You input your user gauge (whatever your predetermined gauge is with size 8 needles & aran yarn), and the program calculates what size needle you actually need to use in order to achieve the pattern gauge with aran yarn.
